      I'm a third-year undergraduate at **Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University**, Beijing, China. 

      I am working on research projects under the supervision of Prof. **Yang Gao**. 
      Currently, I am serving as a student intern in **LeCAR Lab at CMU**, 
      where I am advised by Prof. **Guanya Shi**.
      
      My research interests focus on building scalable and efficient robot learning algorithms, 
      by incorporating both priors from intuitive physics and large scale real-world data.
