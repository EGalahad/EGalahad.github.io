I am a second-year undergraduate student in Yao Class (founded by Andrew Yao), Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University. 

I am currently interested in robotics and reinforcement learning, specifically towards efficient learning through model-based methods and with foundation model guidance. I am also interested in multi-agent reinforcement learning, machine learning systems and distribued systems.

I like coding and enjoys building large scale projects from scratch.
